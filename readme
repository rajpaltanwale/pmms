Step 1: Remove existing version of django-smart-selects. Type pip uninstall django-smart-selects in the terminal.

Step 2: Install the JS-lint branch by typing

pip install git+https://github.com/digi604/django-smart-selects.git@js-unlinting-fixes` in the terminal
in the terminal.

Step 3: Add 'smart_selects', to the INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py.

Step 4: Add from smart_selects.db_fields import ChainedForeignKey in models.py of your app.

Step 5: Add the smart_selects urls into your project's urls.py. This is needed for the Chained Selects and Chained ManyToMany selects. For example:

urlpatterns = patterns('',
url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
url(r'^chaining/', include('smart_selects.urls')),
)
Step 6: You will also need to include jQuery in every page that includes a field from smart_selects. Add USE_DJANGO_JQUERY = True in your project's settings.py.
